            <h2>Malta Doors Poster</h2>
            <img src="images/MaltaDoors.jpg" alt="Artwork 1" />
            <p> This poster was inspired by <em>Te fit-Tazza</em>, a local Maltese company which creates art prints capturing the Maltese aesthetic and identity. This artwork was created entirely
            inside Adobe inDesign, using vector lines and shapes. It depicts the facade of a villa in Imdina, and in my opinion, fits in perfectly with the aesthetic of <em>Te fit-Tazza</em> and
            accurately captures the beauty of that Baroque Maltese architecture.</p>

            <p>With this project, I was tasked to capture footage of a still life, and subsequently create an edit fot it. I decided to incoroporate 'the passing of time' as a theme, inspired by the hourglass I used
                as part of the still life. The song choice, <em> Mice on Venus</em>, encapsulates this theme as it is equally sad, but beautiful. The edit showcases the individual components making up the still life, 
                focusing on the vase of flowers, as the hourglass</p>

            <h2>Front Page Publication</h2>
            <img src="images/FrontPagePublication.jpg" alt="Artwork 3" />
            <p> This work showcases the front page of the hypothetical publication <em>Game Fiend</em>. The design of this front page was inspired by the look of the box art for old Game Boy Advanced video games. This 
            detail adds a nostalgic charm to the cover. At the bottom of the page, you can see three hypothetical articled mentioned in the publication, which reference three video games which I was playing or anticipating
            their release of at the time, which is a nice Easter egg. Overall, I was quite please how it turned out feeling both modern and retro at the same time, whilst still looking sleek.</p>

            <p>The video showcases a short animation of an original character I designed performing a few actions such as walking, floating, and dying. This character, intended to be an original Pokémon design, was designed a 
                while back and remains one of my favourites. Bringing him to life thorugh pixel art, whilst also mimicing the pixel art style of earlier Pokémon games turned out to be a very fun and satisfying process. I feel
                as though the animations all turned out eligible and looking both cute and cool.
