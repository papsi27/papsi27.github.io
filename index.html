            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>Throughout my studies, I've explored a wide range of creative techniques — from digital illustration to experimental typography. This site is a reflection of the ideas and styles that resonated with me most.</p>
            <p>In particular, I’ve chosen works from two units that sparked the most creativity and personal growth. Each piece represents a moment of experimentation, learning, or expression that I’m proud to share.</p>
