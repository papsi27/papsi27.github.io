            <h2><em>About This Project</em></h2>
            <p>Throughout these units, I've explored a wide range of creative techniques â€” from video editing to pixel art and animation. This website is a reflection of all the ideas, inspirations and styles that resonated with me most.</p>
            <p>The works which I have chosen to highlight are those which I not only believe sparkeded the most creativity out of me, but also those which I enjoyed working on the most.</p>
